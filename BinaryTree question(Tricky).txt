Can you construct a binary tree in such a way that the sum of the values of all nodes at each level is a prime number, and each node has a unique value?

Answer::

A root node with value 2 (a prime number).

Its two children nodes with values 3 and 5. Both are primes, and their sum is 8, which is not prime, but we can fix this by choosing appropriate numbers that fit the condition.

Extend the tree ensuring sums at each level respect the prime condition.

You'd start with:
                                                          5 (prime)             Level:0
                                                               /   \
                                                      3 (prime)     2 (prime)   Level:1

Here, the sums at each level are:

Level 0:  5 (prime)

Level 1:  3+2 = 5 (prime)
